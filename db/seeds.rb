description:"The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana (U.S) spans the entirety of Lake Pontchartrain and is 23.83 miles (38.35km) in length. Despite it being opened decades ago in 1959, it is still the longest continuous stretch of bridge over water in the world. The causeway is supported by 9,500 pilings and is so stable that it has suffered a minute amount of damage from major hurricanes and storms when compared to any other causeway worldwide.",

It opened in 1937 and was the longest suspension bridge in the world for almost three decades. The bridge is one of the most recognised and influential symbols of the United States and has been declared a Wonder of the Modern World ",

A motor rotates the central shaft and different arrangements that can be made in the project causes the rotational motion to transfer from one axis to other. The project is mainly made from Mdf, mild steel and Acrylic. The machine can be divided into 4 groups of gears. Each group consists of 4 gears of different dimensions. The machine works in 3 different scenarios.",

A differential is a gear train with three drive shafts that has a property such that the rotational speed of one shaft is the average speeds of the others, or a fixed multiple of that average and Oscillation is the repetitive or periodic variation of an object.
    The Frame of the system is mostly made of Mild steel. The frame that holds the tires oscillates freely. The same frame is connected to the differential.",
